First steps necessary to make the project work was to install all the webpack & babel configuation libraries.

Next, it was important to create all the configuation files to make the project run in both production and development environments.

I had to install all other dependencies such as react, redux, jest and enzyme.

This way, I could have had all the application state use redux instead of keeping it in component state for greater efficiency.
